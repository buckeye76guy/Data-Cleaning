Data Cleaning Tutorial
This is my attempt at doing the exercises for section 3 of 
[An Introduction To Data Cleaning With R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf) article by **Edwin de Jonge** and **Mark van der Loo**. 
This is by no means the correct answers as they were not peer reviewed or presented to the authors of the document.
